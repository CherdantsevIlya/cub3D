## :memo: **About**

_This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way._

### Introduction

The aim of the ``cub3d`` proyect is to create a 3D game using the raycasting technique which is a rendering method implemented in the world-famous ``Wolfenstein 3D`` game.

### Map

The ``cub3D`` executable receives as a single argument the map file we read, which must be of ``.cub`` filetype.

The file must follow these rules:
- There must be header lines before the actual map containing the following:
    - At least a line containing ``NO``, ``SO``, ``EA`` and ``WE`` followed by a valid path to an xpm image
    - A line starting with ``F`` (**f**loor) or ``C`` (**c**eiling) followed by a color in RGB separated by commas
- Only `` `` *(empty)*, ``1`` *(wall)*, ``0`` *(floor)*, and either ``N``, ``S``, ``E`` or ``W`` *(Player starting position looking at **N**orth, **S**outh, **E**ast or **W**est)*, will be accepted characters in our map (except if you add other characters as bonus)
- The map may not be rectangular, but it must be surrounded by walls
- Spaces are allowed but the player cannot walk on them, thus every space must also be closed/surrounded by walls
- There must be a single player on the map

Here's an example of a valid map (not rectangular but still valid):

```
NO ./textures/WALL2.xpm
SO ./textures/WALL21.xpm
WE ./textures/WALL8.xpm
EA ./textures/WALL22.xpm

F 112,112,112
C 53,53,53
